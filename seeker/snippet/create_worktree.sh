# Git Worktree Creation Script
# 
# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# To use this script globally from any directory:
# 
# 1. Copy this script to a global location:
#    sudo cp create_worktree.sh /usr/local/bin/create-worktree
#    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/create-worktree
# 
# 2. Create an alias in your shell profile (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.bash_profile):
#    echo 'alias wt="create-worktree"' >> ~/.zshrc
#    source ~/.zshrc
# 
# 3. Now you can use it from any git repository:
#    wt feature/new-api
#    wt bugfix/vector-search
# 
# USAGE:
# ./create_worktree.sh <branch_name>  (local usage)
#  wt <branch_name>                   (global usage with alias)
# 
# EXAMPLES:
# wt feature/new-api
# wt bugfix/vector-search
# wt experiment/performance-test

# Configuration: Set your preferred AI editor (windsurf or cursor)
AI_EDITOR="windsurf"

set -e  # Exit on any error

# Check if branch name is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <branch_name>"
    echo "Example: $0 feature/new-api"
    exit 1
