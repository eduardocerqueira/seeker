#CODE SUMMARY
'''
This file has all of the code for the food class, which is used to create a food object within the game for the Pacman and Enemy to chase.
The food object has attributes such as x and y coordinates, radius and colour.
The class contains methods such as draw, relocate and getters for the x and y coordinates and radius.
The draw method is used to draw the food as a circle on the screen.
The relocate method is used to relocate the food to a random position on the screen.
The getters are used to get the x and y coordinates and radius of the food object.
