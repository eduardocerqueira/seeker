""" 
Flip a fair coin 100 timesâ€”it gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). 
For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point; for each HT, Bob does,
so e.g. for the sequence THHHT Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. 
Who is most likely to win?

for 100 flips, the probability of Alice winning is
