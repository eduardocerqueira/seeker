# Calender Week 11 - 11 March 2025
# Slothbytes Newsletter Challenge - Hidden Calculater Words
# submit by Shadowdara
# written in Python
# 
# check out my Github Profile please
# https://github.com/shadowdara
#
# I am sure this would be possible a lot less complicated,
# but i like it to complicate simple things
#
# Yeah, you need to install Python to run this script!
#
# And to be honest, i am really sure what the challenge was,
# maybe it is although finding other words you can write with
# just numbers, that has nothing to do with coding,
# so I ended up with this idea.
#
# and i am not sure if 9 is not possible are used as "space",
# but 9 will work in this script and covert it to a "-"
#
# Python is btw my favourite prgramming language
#
# MIT LICENSE Shadowdara 2025
#
# to be honest i am not sure when i started, but i am defenetly
# sitting here a lot longer. (Now its 5:21 pm)
# i suck at coding lol
# i want to learn Java for Minecraft Mods
# but python is way easier so always end up with python
#
# D:
#
# I know my Version is a lot overkill and i wasted defenetly to
# much time for things nobody would ever care about, but at least
# i had a bit of fun thinking about thess problems!
# when you are not completly helpless, is programming mostly fun
#
# Sorry for all this comment spam, but i need this to not getting
# crazy lol!
#
# The next time i will do this in Java or Scala because i think
# this would be much harder!
#
# I am FINISHED and its now 6.05 pm
# this took so much time 
# D:
#
# I hope nobody reads this all lol

Only this Letters are working!

I, Z, E, H, S, G, L, B, -, 0
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0

Type in your Message!

start with "0 " - to exit
start with "1 " - to convert numbers to letters
start with "2 " - to convert letters to numbers

e.g:                     1 Hello
and the output would be: 07734
""")
