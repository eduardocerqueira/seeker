	Originally posted: June 1, 2023

	Purpose: Downloads and installs the latest available Jamf Connect software
	for Mac directly on the client. This avoids having to manually download
	and store an up-to-date installer on a distribution server every month.
	
	Instructions: Optionally update the sha256Checksum value with a
	known SHA 256 string. Run the script with elevated privileges.
	If using Jamf Pro, consider replacing the sha256Checksum value
	with "$4", entering the checksum as script parameter in a policy.

    Updated on: 09/19/2024
	Updated by: @andrewmbarnett (https://gist.github.com/AndrewMBarnett)
	
	Updates:
	- Added in the option to download a targeted version of Jamf Connect
	- Added in to show the latest version of Jamf Connect
	- Added in a check to see if the connectVersion variable is set to either download the targeted version or the latest
