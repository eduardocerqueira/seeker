# SET PROMPT
# $' ... ' is necessary to include control characters, eg \e
# %{ ... %} encloses colours to indicate that it shouldn't count towards line length
#
# \e[2m = dimmed
# %n = username
#
# \e[0;37m = normal, white
# @ = literal @
#
# \e[93m = bright yellow
# %~ = current directory
# 
# \e[2;36 = dim cyan/teal (it comes before the command to make sure the control escaping works)
# $(`command -v __git_ps1 >/dev/null` && __git_ps1 " [%s]") = if git-prompt is available, insert the git status when in a git repository
# " [%s]" = the format of the git status; status (eg branch) preceded by a space and surrounded by brackets (the quotation marks are to keep the space there)
# \e[0m = reset to normal after coloured git status so that the colour can be set to white (it comes after the command to make sure command escaping works)
# 
# \e[1;97m = bold, bright white
# %# = The prompt symbol, % for normal user, # for sudo
# \e[0m = Reset to default colours for the user input part of the prompt
# End with a space before user input
