"""
Project Summary Generator
-------------------------

Purpose:
This script provides a summarized view of a project's directory structure and content. It filters out certain 
files, directories, and file suffixes while optionally including others. The final summary is written into 
a file named 'PROJECT_SUMMARY.txt' within the directory where the script resides.

Configuration:
- Exclusions:
    * File Suffixes: .pyc, .json
    * File Names: .env, cc.py, concat.py, PROJECT_SUMMARY.txt
    * Directories: env
    * Top Level Directories: node_modules
    * Hidden Directories: .git
- Inclusions (despite exclusions):
    * Files: package.json

Placement in a Larger Project:
This script is designed to reside in the root directory of your project. However, if it's placed inside the `/utils` 
directory or a similar structure, it will treat the root directory as the one above where it's located.

Usage:
Run the script within the project's directory to generate the 'PROJECT_SUMMARY.txt'.

Customization:
Adjust the constants at the start of the script to tailor the inclusions and exclusions according to your project's needs.
