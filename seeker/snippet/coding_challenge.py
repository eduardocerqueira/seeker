# Write a function that takes the two lists as parameters and returns the three lists:
#   1. a list of people in list A that are *not* in list B
#   2. a list of people in list B that are *not* in list A
#   3. a list of people that are in both lists
# Then, in the main function use those lists to print output to the console like:
#
# "List A containts the following unique members: person1, person 2, person3, etc.
#  List B contains the following unique members: person 4, person 5, person 6, etc.
#  These people are in both lists: person 7, person8, person 9, etc."
