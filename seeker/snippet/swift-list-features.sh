# List Swift language features the compiler knows about.
#
# Usage:
#
#     swift-list-features [version]     # default: main branch
#
# Examples:
#
#     swift-list-features               # Queries main branch
#     swift-list-features 5.9           # Queries release/5.9 branch
#
# This script uses curl to download the file in which the language features
# are defined from the Swift repo and uses Clang to parse it.
